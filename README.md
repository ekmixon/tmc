# tmc
Threat Mapping Catalogue

![](tmc/static/TMCv1.png "TMC Diagram")
â€‹
## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
- Flask
- Sqlite

## Installation

Clone this github repository and from its root folder install its requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can set the enviornment in which the app is running by setting the FLASK_ENV variable to ```development``` or ```production```:

```
export FLASK_ENV=<environment varible>
```

Then run the following commands:

```
export FLASK_APP=tmc
flask init-db
flask run
```

Once the server has started, access the application through localhost:5555. You will need to register an user and log in in order to use the application.

To load the database with the data from [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) access the following path. Please be patiente, since this operation **really takes a while**:

```
localhost:5555/first-time
```

Keep in mind that the next time you want to run the application, you **don't have to** initilizate the database, since doing it will erase any content loaded in it. Repeat the previous steps without that command:

```
export FLASK_ENV=<environment varible>
export FLASK_APP=tmc
flask run
```

# Making the APP public

If you prefer, you can change the port and make the app publicly available by running the following command:

```
flask run -p <number> -h 0.0.0.0
```
